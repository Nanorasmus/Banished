Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

all surfaces and be physically connected to any solid block no matter the shape.\n- By shift-clicking on a Label with an item you'll be able to change its image, showing that item you selected.\n- Clicking on a Label will let the player interact with the block behind, making it perfect for your storage systems.\n- Images shown by Labels are pixelated and colored to better fit Minecraft style. This works seamlessly for any item.\n- Can accept Glow Ink Sacks to make then glow in the dark.\n- Can be colored with any dye.\n- Using a Feather on them will display the item name.\n- Visuals can he heavily customized with the configs and texture packs.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

Just create a `.js` file and let's get started.\n\nHere's simple example which adds a gunpowder for creepers:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addEntityLootModifier(\"minecraft:creeper\")\n        .randomChance(0.3) // 30% chance\n        .thenAdd(\"minecraft:gunpowder\");\n});\n```\n\nInstead of using a loot table for reference, you can also apply the modification to all entities:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addLootTypeModifier(LootType.ENTITY) // you also can use multiple types\n        .logName(\"It's raining loot\") // you can set a custom name for logging\n        .weatherCheck({\n            raining: true,\n        })\n        .thenModify(Ingredient.getAll(), (itemStack) => {\n            // you have to return an item!\n            return itemStack.withCount(itemStack.getCount() * 2);\n        });\n});\n```\n\nNext, let's check if the player holds a specific item:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addBlockLootModifier(\"#forge:ores\") // keep in mind this is a block tag not an item tag\n        .matchEquip(EquipmentSlot.MAINHAND, Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n        .thenAdd(\"minecraft:gravel\");\n\n    // for MainHand and OffHand you can also use:\n    // matchMainHand(Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n    // matchOffHand(Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n});\n```\n\n## **⚙️ More Information**\nFor more information about the usage and the functionality of the mod, please\nvisit our [wiki](https://github.com/AlmostReliable/lootjs/wiki) or explore the [examples](https://github.com/AlmostReliable/lootjs/tree/1.18/examples/server_scripts).\n\n ","published":"2022-06-27T18:05:23.475024Z","updated":"2024-07-16T10:55:23.564697Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":222244,"followers":19,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["mFLuNFHm","hdvavw2q","9P5V9gIO","wXTFesGW","VPYMwdDZ","tCW7mX1B","NMgJ2BlW","4JTbTxna","M7zQPypE","DtITrdt2","TwuesVHU","dc4FblBM","mQY75nBx","43ysRHNC","xIhBIDCV","cqtZlIPm","QJcpcmCW","rFw5aG3j","ImRUsMr4","T6sCwY4E","f2PysaRK","6aIOGY3T","dIIoIaGP","WKbyXlEH","4iK3pEyB","pDtOjljn","339GMBvC","ZarmSG5O","TBtmuPUD","n50jyCjI","7sHZinNx","ir4lOEDc","jvKVmC1y","1BTiNfZJ","s11oQXBD","1Utbex3o","fMlyQgDv","o4CsupJu","CTvG0oqw","FhBctaP5","azVN541R","jvfh1QhA","WqJHHvUW","4qZRB2qr","gFOZANKr","hYqY2ME4","4bA9z4Qr","72Tq9bfK","7TuXqSRh","R70GmPoq","felHSOYU"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fJFETWDN/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"jvKVmC1y","project_id":"fJFETWDN","author_id":"W7UYQWZT","featured":true,"name":"LootJS-Fabric-1.19.2-2.9.1","version_number":"1.19.2-2.9.1+fabric","changelog":"### Changed\n- Fix bug where loot does not drop if CraftTweaker is installed together with LootJS on fabric\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-17T12:32:56.949998Z","downloads":1831,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"8f1041fd370360160a5dae71d45050a257c142195bcb2ff2875cf40d3adb65cc894ec6029b7f64a30ae6e103bbe37e292ce1f56150f6a33a407b64d998ca8cea","sha1":"fb4c3148b4e2e12f8f210cbf69f013478e59f544"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fJFETWDN/versions/jvKVmC1y/lootjs-fabric-1.19.2-2.9.1.jar","filename":"lootjs-fabric-1.19.2-2.9.1.jar","primary":true,"size":188948,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"umyGl7zF","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"PMRuK7v3","user":{"id":"qtbuSRQ6","username":"Relentless","name":"Relentless","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16513358?v=4","bio":"Hobby developer mostly developing bots or mods.","created":"2022-02-28T01:07:44.015749Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"PMRuK7v3","user":{"id":"W7UYQWZT","username":"Lytho","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29131229?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-18T18:30:43.104912Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lootjs-fabric-1.19.2-2.9.1.jar"},"mods\\entityjs-0.2.4-1.19.2-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"51c6b7f61a819e3976a2d5af11559812db994ce7140fd0872efb79a9c837bdc5eb12a51dd4db99d532cdb856d4e7de3eda78285d49fa37d971383e7a9f9fc185","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"OvPZ16yX","slug":"entityjs","project_type":"mod","team":"MnHhSQuA","title":"EntityJS","description":"This mod uses KubeJS to dynamically register entities with full AI/Animation/Spawn Control support!","body":"<p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/7GvkBYs\"><img style=\"display: block;

","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-06-17T08:24:45.317893Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2563815,"followers":2138,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K","GUHZDxpy","9IcJV4UJ","dUVBjrNs","ylmBQ38A"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"pmMCbsN3","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.19+] Mouse Tweaks 2.22","version_number":"1.19-2.22-fabric","changelog":"- Updated to Minecraft 1.19.\n- Removed the Architectury issue workaround as it's been fixed in Architectury a while ago.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-06-12T03:20:00.158842Z","downloads":384385,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"6004ccf55a3013c54fdbef3b28613c3326231d2c","sha512":"7d68ecfbfa1caa75dd1d402ff9577480e5dfeadd554282e48510eec8d6ba3b590f297a4d246d44c07ff9a5ae8086136001552b0701a486133c296491acb6982c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/1.19-2.22-fabric/MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.19-2.22.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.19-2.22.jar","primary":true,"size":77282,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-fabric-mc1.19-2.22.jar"},"mods\\vivecraft-1.19.2-1.1.11-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"79d9733f168cfd9bd3843f9bf36f04dedb4b81e04404aefd8771d9d05c5a7a32518013e1a270f2ec58c153f47026f7ef0de82498cc04bfd3da2db3142e72c2b5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"wGoQDPN5","slug":"vivecraft","project_type":"mod","team":"2AFOHfyr","title":"Vivecraft","description":"A Minecraft VR mod on a loader of your choice!","body":"# Vivecraft\nVivecraft is the mod that transforms Minecraft into an exceptional VR experience in room-scale or seated play!\nMore info [https://www.vivecraft.org/](https://www.vivecraft.org/ \"https://www.vivecraft.org/\").\n\nVivecraft is a well-known VR mod that goes way back.

However, we have rewritten it so it can run on Fabric and Quilt as well.\n\n### Can other players see my hands/What about NONVR, VSE and VFE?\nThis mod also has **NONVR included** in the jar. VR Is disabled by default, and can be enabled in the Main menu.\n\nFor other players to see you hands you will need to have this mod and a serverside mod. The serverside extensions (VSE and VFE) *work* as well as fabric works with them, however you **do not need to use them**. This mod will run in NONVR mode on the server allowing you to see other peoples hands. Since 1.0.0 it is also customizable like the standalone server mods.\n\n### Does it work with MCXR?\nNo this is a separate mod, and does not interface with MCXR\n\n### Does it run natively on the Quest?\nNo, but maybe in the future. \nIn the meantime, there is [Questcraft](https://questcraft.org/ \"https://questcraft.org/\") which uses a modified version of this, to make it compatible with the Oculus/Meta Quest.\n\n### What about Sodium/Iris ... Will it work?\nSodium does work.\nIris works.\nAny other mod is untested. Mod compatibility is an important thing to us, however, it is not simple. For now we focus on getting it to be stable, after which, we will work on compatibility.\n\n### What about Optifine?\nSince 1.0.0 Optifine is compatible with the mod, but not required\n\n### What about 1.19.0?\nThere is one version available for it, but it will not get any further updates.","published":"2022-09-05T18:56:09.045191Z","updated":"2024-07-14T19:33:45.245731Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":510878,"followers":431,"categories":["game-mechanics","library"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","23w13a_or_b","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w14potato","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["rPsuSvmr","OpkjsSWH","aB0rF95L","eLJm9dQD","m3mtHRE7","3cs5bbKS","1fybWUMG","zQikY8nx","zm1kQhh2","A9UwaVJH","XtgCncAy","oG2wzMMs","zFMrHqFl","A4Qp4FNH","V3kwZYnq","EUxQkAau","XNMd5A8s","vxgPBH9t","9ClAyVkk","ylotc9XA","c4GVVDt9","7DoAhT6I","hH2WREzi","oJ0VxFIg","WBwBdTX1","GJCsuaN9","XJoINSsa","4hA4xhWQ","Su6fgfmB","Q9CH9xrP","nrXZX9to","oUXhhWmY","JHzvX05b","2a4thqoQ","zyWe7Stu","oz3ekfuS","dOEvFwko","L6RNCTmc","qgPPCQd8","PlC5FH4q","734yK5dP","kZxYYjJL","gUmcLmSU","nCDZVWMR","KtOSPp6N","hVkMOY1N","PeIYFrho","ocB2DmA0","vgEChuPI","Tf6d0imJ","CEYZSmz6","rweHuR9Q","FShXrtq1","TFANY1Cg","eIni94Pv","eXCDAKT9","7IpbBPkT","ObIsEBMg","k7kRkE5X","VDDW0akX","BRfGFMNk","UcRi43sa","7nxCHV22","l8DN6Hs7","8Tyjgyyp","uE8vnQjs","5HCJmiRu","84ZbnWde","KNZGPnrx","dg8l9Q15","8affVTqp","D1NT0xDw","mvIlT1Gz","SEZd5kZQ","TMNCSxke","8jLianEh","rO2eZO1C","FrDBGxJ8","NQAJ0s7J","YMfB6v9c","yy2xhuIS","wWg2MFT3","UF532GJx","ea1xoeZb","zrHrjDZj","KYdSjSta","lTNrm51W","6YfpbAnH","6I25aIZo","ZiPZ1r2G","KMJ9xbnK","IS0Nbc2W","VwoIhheR","kSyOGxGr","yUiMftcF","Ykkdiy8Y","Z6wNZU7L","PbhGuiy6","qRgMlY0m","a1s4ufzI","Rg65HdRK","4Cr6rBjG","UGv8qYF0","pt0Jb93A","5emKCjg8","Me05D9G0","ooIa4JWO","vrh0E2re","FlblNmM6","9DpL9ihi","xmfdymW6","eSYvUEuS","rFIGUiX8","6o3NyzUc","l5a8eIgu","RxwcBgIy","tc3tHRSS","YAo2t4LG","gcyRQl5v","iGkrlHqs","767lrhy2","TBMk8jLa","9ejQYjPi","yIC9FXco","9Fx0n3wx","EJrq4mkH","6N9vn0vL","kb3ua7q1","YYnU0sX2","6eE7Hkfv","nUUqfpyT","6cKwivrJ","uS7wtsgb","Tawakp4o","UEvW6N0W","RbSvzkfJ","RaKhz8aR","qJNY8qzv","EF4y2n45","OfxGnUt2","uIpbfFvX","I1nvuFhE","iXamTiIn","TGkdRIwQ","OELX8ifH","GRKk4avh","GX0Gmpra","vzHXVKRP","w2AOYKDp","4NmmVOuV","c1FDoTSa","oDVUKSjg","tBefECvx","oHG2CPZr","TtGtyWF9","aS8kFqDN","LUqZ64nD","YJeLwI98","IHEaPBkL","k3bv6md5","OBr6y1NS","Foimp4iG","9FFy2x2K","Bh1n5144","ZzRtgJ7q","lz137ryY","l8GV8nGA","L7Lg1jHL","FU15kjhK","f049hMOm","J5LlogXl","iKTL6CKL","ITSxOiQT","sPFTEOvV","kIiwNa2y","wXLhLSYC","lvZsHT0Z","LFCWJtdW","TlmOiMds","6lguq2w3","UMsmsclZ","uUE3Jx0f","fSXHVbvi","Z06leBgS","SvDYHIF6","Jzdw2xdB","Q1pDMmyX","Bl3aJUeJ","yNvTV0lx","HNIS7a20","SjXcAQ03","r9ggLqnM","m60rvxkf","zlPLbFWx","7XwtgvYz","KWBbtJxy","6Sh89IDb","5ZVzT5NJ","xC0Vh8WO","pFQDyd0F","TamQSKTn","sAb7IaAF","Dh7ZdPaU","zNFkTQJM","gpCrdyRv","vcX6E3oY","YNJPtEbN","ZmODG6dv","YJn1CGtg","I0mEXotH","ZJxF5i4V","mBApMZXk","DgOVNJ7A","8r3OJST3","frQq27I6"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGoQDPN5/f55ecb94626ba1e51977b217d6a58f500cd86ca1.png"},"version":{"id":"7XwtgvYz","project_id":"wGoQDPN5","author_id":"qIiO9UwX","featured":false,"name":"Vivecraft 1.19.2-1.1.11-fabric","version_number":"1.19.2-1.1.11-fabric","changelog":"- fix some mods breaking hud rendering\r\n- fix radial menu and pointer keyboard rendering","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-07-09T21:42:49.584198Z","downloads":391,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c83b5f79ae90f1e9b7791a04caf83d345692da74","sha512":"79d9733f168cfd9bd3843f9bf36f04dedb4b81e04404aefd8771d9d05c5a7a32518013e1a270f2ec58c153f47026f7ef0de82498cc04bfd3da2db3142e72c2b5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGoQDPN5/versions/7XwtgvYz/vivecraft-1.19.2-1.1.11-fabric.jar","filename":"vivecraft-1.19.2-1.1.11-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":4796462,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2AFOHfyr","user":{"id":"DzLrfrbK","username":"IMS","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31803019?v=4","bio":"the Iris guy","created":"2020-12-01T00:40:02.137876Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"2AFOHfyr","user":{"id":"6r2gRRvf","username":"jrbudda","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1927235?v=4","bio":"I write software for a living.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

(Special Thanks to everyone on the Hex Casting Discord server for answering all my questions, you all gave me the energy to make this.)\n\n\nThe main feature of Hextended Staves is, as you might have guessed, more staves. Mostly, the goal of this addon is to add more options for the player to choose from to fit their style or aesthetic. It's not necessarily about making a tool that is inherently better, but you may find that some items may have a small edge to them. I do plan to add other Hexcasting-related gear with functional benefits, but I'm very new to modding, so in-depth mechanics are a tad far from my reach at the moment. The bulk of this mod is and will continue to be tools that just look nice, with not a _ton_ of benefit. That said, I also want to make special staves or other tools that have special properties, but again, far down the road.\n\nThe staves added currently are only those that model to vanilla or Hex Casting aesthetic, but as my modding knowledge grows I will add cosmetic staves that mesh with the styles of other mods like Botania or Ars Nouveau. If you have a suggestion for a staff, ping me in the Hex Casting Discord server or leave a comment and I'll add it to the list!\n\n \n## Dependencies\nAs an addon to Hex Casting, you'll need it and all its dependencies.

Its features are tailored to be functional, aesthetically viable, and complementary to preexisting content and provide many new ways to enhance your Vanilla+ experience.\n> The mod requires Moonlight Library<br>\n> While supported, Fabric version might be missing some minor features as the mod is mainly for Forge<br>\n> You are free to include this mod in your modpack\n\nTranslated in the following languages!\nDeutsch | Polski | Fran&ccedil;ais | Русский | Italiano | English | Če&scaron;tina | 한국어 | Українська | Portugu&ecirc;s | Српски | Espa&ntilde;ol | Қазақ | Bahasa Melayu | Pirate Speech | 简体中文 (中国) | 繁體中文 (香港) | 繁體中文 (台灣) | T&uuml;rk&ccedil;e</span></p>\n\n<center>\n<h2> 🖼️ Media 🖼️ </h2>\n</center>\nCheck out some reviews here\n<br>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/avG7OTcsJA0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHQSjNacrm4\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<center>\n<h2>❓ F. A. Q. ❓</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric.

Works with many items from other mods.\n\n<center>\n\n![separator]\n\n\n### **New Circle Components**\n\n![An overcomplicated spell circle for showing off the new components.](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/HexGloop/blob/main/externalassets/GloopCircle.gif?raw=true)\n\n</center>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Circle Components</summary>\n\n- **Pedestals** - Can be used to embed non pattern iotas in the circle.\n- **Syncetrix** - Sends media waves across short distances for \"wireless\" circles.\n- **Accelerator** - Speeds up the circle.\n- **Undulator** - Emits a redstone signal when the media wave is passing through it.\n- **Gloopy Slate Chest** - Provides an inventory for the circle to draw blocks and items from.\n\n</details>\n\n<center>\n\n![separator]\n\n### **More Features**\n\n![A screenshot of a room with various hexgloop items on pedestals. The floor is made of charged amethyst blocks. There are slate chests on the side. The items are: two scripts, a casters coin, two casting potions, and a focal ring.](https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/HexGloop/blob/main/externalassets/shop.png?raw=true)\n\n#### *Check out the gallery for more pictures !*\n\n</center>\n\n- **Focal Jewelry** - Wearable foci you can read and write while wearing it.\n- **Scripts** - Similar to foci but can only hold lists of up to 16 patterns, great for early game hexes.\n- **Multi Focus** - A pre-end spellbook like item with fewer slots.\n- **Truename Protection** - Warnings in chat when you expose your truename and a new spell to void existing references to it.\n- **Scroll Copying** - Right clicking the Hex Notebook on a hanging scroll copies the pattern on the current page onto the scroll.\n- **Casting Potion** - Casts when you drink it. Great for shops !\n- **Fidgets and The Mind's Orchard** - A series of items that let you select states to use in your hexes.\n- **Caster's Coins** - Coins that hold an iota that can only be read once.\n- **Mirrors** - Reflect another item into your offhand for hexes to use.\n\n<center>\n\n<br><br>\n\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://hexgloop.hexxy.media\"><img src=\"https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/HexGloop/blob/main/externalassets/hexdoc-badgecozy.svg?raw=true\" alt=\"A badge for hexdoc in the style of Devins Badges\" width=225></a>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://addons.hexxy.media\" height=75>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/HexGloop/blob/main/externalassets/addon-badge-cozy.svg?raw=true\" alt=\"A badge for addons.hexxy.media in the style of Devins Badges\" width=200>\n</a>\n\n</center>\n\n[separator]: https://github.com/SamsTheNerd/HexGloop/blob/main/externalassets/separator.png?raw=true \"Hex Gloop Decorative Section Separator, a purple bar with green bits.\"\n","published":"2023-08-01T05:01:02.778496Z","updated":"2023-12-10T03:39:06.018094Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":16045,"followers":27,"categories":["equipment","magic"],"additional_categories":["food","game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["vDpFcpSI","h5MY0JKQ","3ejBFJWo","tcyNIgEk","pGqIjuG3","bbJTxfAQ","V4MD9QIm","CHF6jsG8","YKqZB4wU","RIelWK4X","BkYDC1pd","9wALKKLf","hvRNXDrp","J6X6JaQW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ryfyOhoP/fd47e532776ba9580c2e7b847b5308b7b8b9d7ae.png"},"version":{"id":"hvRNXDrp","project_id":"ryfyOhoP","author_id":"dtHXyZU1","featured":false,"name":"Hex Gloop 1.19.2-0.2.0 [Fabric]","version_number":"1.19.2-0.2.0-fabric","changelog":"## 0.2.0\n\n### Added\n\n- Hex Blade and Hex Pickaxe\n- Frogi - cast on double jump\n- Holiday staves and reference staves\n- Undulator - detect circle waves\n- Library Card - access libraries across dimensions\n- Scripts - cheaper limited pattern list holders\n- Essence Stone - use spawn egg colors as your pigment\n- Syncetrix - wireless circles\n- Deco blocks:\n    - Caster's Carpet - shrinks grid while standing on it\n    - Slate Lamp - glows\n    - Charged Amethyst Block - good for beacons\n    - Caster's Gate - passage for enlightened casters\n    - Caster's Bridge - support for enlightened casters\n- Mind in a Jar\n- Mepts !

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can

fun addon containing genie lamps, mage blocks, specks, world scrying, and more!","body":"A fun addon containing genie lamps, mage blocks, specks, world scrying, and more!\n\n**Genie Lamps**\nWhen you hold right-click, they cast twenty times per second. You can use genie reflection patterns to get how long since the lamp started casting, where the caster originally was, what direction the caster was originally looking, what velocity the caster was originally traveling with, and the lamp's current media levels.\n\n**Arch Lamps**\nThe upgraded form of genie lamps, they cast twenty times per second while activated and just sitting in your inventory. You can only have one active at a time. You can use archgenie reflection patterns to get how long since the lamp started casting, where the caster originally was, what direction the caster was originally looking, what velocity the caster was originally traveling with, and the lamp's current media levels. Arch lamps have an iota storage similar to the Ravenmind, allowing you to remember information between casts if needed. Arch lamps have a Terminate Archgenie spell that lets you deactivate them, either from inside the lamp or outside. Archgenie reflections can be cast from outside the lamp, letting you make a trinket that acts as a selector for an arch lamp to take effect.\n\n**World Scrying**\nTo complement arch lamps, Hexical provides an entire section of scrying patterns that return information about the world with more added whether I feel they would be useful. You can automagically extinguish yourself if you are burning, clear the weather if it's rainy, and idly impulse yourself if you are sprinting.\n- Is an entity burning?\n- How long will an entity burn without being put out?\n- Is an entity touching water?\n- How's the weather?\n- Is an entity sprinting?\n- Is an entity sleeping?\n- What enchantments does this item have?\n- What status effects am I afflicted with?\n- What status effects will that tipped arrow bestow on me?\n- Is this food edible by dogs?\n\n**Specks**\nSpecks are floating iota you can conjure into your world. They can represent any iota and can even be moved, rotated, and otherwise edited for free once they are etched into the world! They also take on your pigment.\n\n**Mage Blocks**\nMage blocks are conjurable blocks that come with a suite of modifiers, like breaking in a chain reaction, easily swapping out with real blocks, disappearing after a set duration, being bouncy, and more! These modifiers are free so you can make exactly the conjured blocks you need for free, and there will be more to come!\n\n**Conjured Staves**\nA conjured staff has a hex preprogrammed into it and a battery, as well as a rank. After you left and right-click a number of times equal to the rank, they cast with the stack starting with true and false booleans corresponding to your left and right clicks. They also support an internal iota storage, which allows them to retain memory of previous inputs.\n\n**Telepathy**\nTelepathy lets you read and write thoughts. Mainly, this is used to play sounds only you can hear, display iota to yourself, and detect keybinds.\n- How long have you held a configurable keybind?\n- Play a ping sound only you can hear!\n- Play a click sound only you can hear!\n- Flash something across the screen!\n- Display an iota above the hotbar!\n\n**Grimoires**\nGrimoires are like Hexal macros but in item form! You can write up to sixteen pattern-to-hex bindings inside of them and when you draw the pattern with a staff, it instead casts the hex. You can also restrict your grimoire to a certain number of uses so using iota embedding, you can give out limited access to your true name.\n\n**Living Scrolls**\nLiving scrolls are decorative scrolls that wiggle just like staff-drawn patterns. They can also display pattern lists, where they change between patterns, all in magical sync.\n\n**Identifier Iota**\n- You can identify blocks and entities, and compare them to each other.\n- You can get types of status effects and enchantments.\n- Sounds iota and playing them are to come!\n\n**Miscellanous Spells**\n- Chorus Blink - Chorus Blink consumes a chorus fruit from your inventory and uses it to teleport you up to sixteen blocks around you for the price of a single dust.\n- Displace can only be cast from a spell circle and teleports any entity inside it to any other point inside it for just three amethyst shards. It also does not have any risk of items splattering.\n\n**Quality of Life**\nYou can now move around while having the spellcasting screen open and write to abacuses now!","published":"2024-03-24T01:46:36.394873Z","updated":"2024-04-30T19:51:15.263173Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1635,"followers":7,"categories":["magic"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["Z3VTASYu","IDe2Cq66","pkWDO7W1"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/xWqLqLJ4/9a01377de72a96858e3eaedd8b506b0e050d11a3.png"},"version":{"id":"pkWDO7W1","project_id":"xWqLqLJ4","author_id":"7mkD5r4g","featured":false,"name":"Hexical 1.2.0","version_number":"1.2.0","changelog":"- added more achievements\n- added lightning rod staff, with strong knockback and slow swing speed\n- added Displace spell for circles to teleport entities for cheap\n- added energized mage blocks modifier to emit Redstone power\n- added living scrolls\n- added proper speck text rendering\n- added more meta-evals\n    - added Janus' Gambit\n    - added Sisyphus' Gambit\n- added z-axis rotation for specks\n- added iota storage for conjured staves\n- added Dioscuri Gambit II\n- changed Conjure Speck to push the speck to the stack\n- changed Nephthys' Gambit to no longer need a number, instead relying on tail length\n- fixed accidental swapping of Sloth and Racer's Purification\n- fixed being able to use Recharge Item to recharge lamps\n- fixed conjured staves not casting properly\n- fixed mage block breaking particles\n- fixed Nephthys' Gambit not working on single patterns\n- fixed speck pattern saving\n- remove ambit requirement for altering specks\n- updated documentation\n- overhauled a lot of code\n- overhauled world scrying\n    - added enchantment patterns\n    - added entity patterns\n    - added food patterns\n    - added identifier patterns\n    - added item patterns\n    - added status effect patterns\n    - added world patterns","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-30T19:51:16.195806Z","downloads":1079,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e46ef8ffc47ce384561393de5e594ad639d98040c8e8ee0cb53b2cbc37d0edd0cf870f560b9ad9e5a8a12e8e8ec5414c211cec66d22625455d352752c8d8408f","sha1":"b695cb09958653f9df4c33b76cc63ff1333023d4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/xWqLqLJ4/versions/pkWDO7W1/hexical-fabric-1.19.2-1.2.0.jar","filename":"hexical-fabric-1.19.2-1.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":529434,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nTW3yKrm","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fcvSSuBe","user":{"id":"7mkD5r4g","username":"miyucomics","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/7mkD5r4g/1c8e53959685a53b4f36ce333d2e729b7a7801af.jpeg","bio":"Just a 15 year old programmer making mods in my free time!","created":"2022-02-26T17:08:26.889023Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"hexical-fabric-1.19.2-1.2.0.jar"},"mods\\probejs-5.3.4-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"dc0ce547d543ce0f266773fedb513d9893eed2002b8c4a83c3fe917556e42b406d17ae25add2f968812560a6638583129ad74a06a6ecc4e59782cdb49c9c5304","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"JJNYRb4B","slug":"probejs","project_type":"mod","team":"EOgWrhpy","title":"ProbeJS","description":"Supercharging your modpack experience.","body":"A typing generator mod to generate KubeJS typings.

Not installing the mod will not make the extension unusable.\n\n\n### Usage\n\nInstall the mod, run \"/probejs dump\" in your game in the singleplayer, then open your .minecraft in VSCode as a folder.\n\nThe .minecraft folder is the parent folder of the KubeJS folder.\n\nType docs and autocompletion should appear when you open the js files under the KubeJS folder.\n\nAlso, try to type like @item or @block to see snippets generated.\n\n \n\n*In case nothing shows up in VSCode, check that:*\n\n- Many JSON files started with \"probe\" in the .vscode folder are under your .minecraft folder.\n- There is a \"probe\" folder under the KubeJS folder, and many files ending with \".d.ts\" are in the folder.\n- None of the \".d.ts\" files have syntax errors VSCode indicates.\n \n\nIf all three steps are correct, you might need to configure your VSCode to make it accept how ProbeJS dumps the typing, or just the VSCode can't handle the JS project created by ProbeJS.\n\nIf any steps fail, especially step 3, please submit an issue to GitHub.\n","published":"2023-11-27T11:24:48.009180Z","updated":"2024-06-18T09:30:40.018266Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":54816,"followers":12,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["XIxTqWLF","yzoeAC7L","RHQ11l5Y","ySmIDEms","oiljyqSe"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JJNYRb4B/fc2c1372d7582544fc5cc2ac25ea59fc81d7213f.gif"},"version":{"id":"ySmIDEms","project_id":"JJNYRb4B","author_id":"EwDnjqIO","featured":false,"name":"ProbeJS 5.3.4","version_number":"5.3.4","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-11T13:01:29.496211Z","downloads":419,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"3de26ec8dd8a470141e71d40b3499e459a0edb2b","sha512":"dc0ce547d543ce0f266773fedb513d9893eed2002b8c4a83c3fe917556e42b406d17ae25add2f968812560a6638583129ad74a06a6ecc4e59782cdb49c9c5304"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JJNYRb4B/versions/ySmIDEms/probejs-5.3.4-fabric.jar","filename":"probejs-5.3.4-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":820096,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"umyGl7zF","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EOgWrhpy","user":{"id":"EwDnjqIO","username":"Prunoideae","name":"Li Junyu","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/EwDnjqIO/fa394454387ec892d4e146873a766a9efde53276.png","bio":"PhD Student in Marine Environmental Science, HKUST.","created":"2022-06-18T12:56:39.653826Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"probejs-5.3.4-fabric.jar"},"mods\\Patchouli-1.19.2-77-FABRIC.jar":{"sha512":"499e5d558964c482aef0cd29affa12749c494b13859bf6471fc8d691b3e97f5ce3b5defc83f4ea9161f0532ec88da6049748136d60b44428a5cc8312d8cee066","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"nU0bVIaL","slug":"patchouli","project_type":"mod","team":"72JcM90m","title":"Patchouli","description":"Accessible, Data-Driven, Dependency-Free Documentation for Minecraft Modders and Pack Makers","body":"[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm0.png)](https://violetmoon.org)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm1.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm2.png)](https://twitter.com/vazkiimods)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm3.png)](https://discord.gg/vm)\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/hero/patchouli.png)\n\n---\n\n# About\n\n**Patchouli** is a mod that aims to provide easy to implement, data-driven documentation for minecraft modders and modpack makers alike.\n\nPatchouli's systems allow any modder or modpack maker to quickly create beautiful books full of user experience enhancing features.
